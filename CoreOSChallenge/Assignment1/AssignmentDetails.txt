The test cases were created based mainly on the input file that was given on the assignment. I first tested items that were not keys as an input value. I didn't want the program to error but rather show that the key value was not paired with any values.  The 2ed test verifies that the values for the key are displayed correctly in a state where there are only values. The third test verifies a case where there are dead keys. The fourth test was modified to call itself inside the key value pairs and displays that none of the values are repeated. The last test shows that all tests and key value pairs are displayed.
