Hello,

First, thank you for taking time to look at my challenge solutions. Each challenge has a directory with more details for each program. For the first two challenges I chose to use Python for the solution. They were ran in terminal. I have included screenshots for both programs, but just for clarification:
Assignment 1:
	./KeyValue.py filename key
Assignment 2:
	./IPv4Finder.py directory

The last challenge was the most fun, as I had never worked with creating custom classes for Objective-C before. I chose to create a Pokedex class (more details in the folder.) 

Thank you,

Eric Dockery
