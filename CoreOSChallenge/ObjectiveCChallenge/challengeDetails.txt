For this challenge, I decided to implement a Pokémon trainers Pokedex.  As this was my first time creating a class for an Objective-C project, I had to extensively use the documentation on the developer site in order to create the class.  A little backstory if you are not familiar with Pokémon. The trainers pokedex keeps track of all of the Pokémon that a trainer has seen and captured.  For this Assignment I just used captured Pokémon for the pokedex. I used a command line tool to test my class. I first tested if it was adding Pokémon correctly. After verification I added another Pokémon to the pokedex and verified that it was working correctly. After that I added the same Pokémon back to the pokedex to verify that the Pokedex wouldn’t count multiples of the same Pokémon.
